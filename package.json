  "description": "This is an implementation of a Merkle Tree based payment pool in Solidity for ERC-20 tokens. This project was inspired by this Ethereum research post: https://ethresear.ch/t/pooled-payments-scaling-solution-for-one-to-many-transactions/590. A longer description around the motivations behind this project is available here: ***TODO: Add medium post URL here***. This project includes a payment pool smart contract that leverages Merkle Trees. Also included is a JS lib to create Merkle Trees, derive Merkle roots, and Merkle proofs that have metadata attached to the proofs that aid this smart contract in managing the payment pool.",
